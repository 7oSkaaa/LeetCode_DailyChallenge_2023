        Our array have 2n elements in the form "x1,x2,x3,..,xn,y1,y2,y3,..,yn"

        Our goal is to shuffle our array to be in the form of "x1,y1,x2,y2,...."
        so all we need is to iterate over the first half and take the i th element from x followed by the i th element
        from y  "i th element form y = position of x's element + n"

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) // iterate over the first half
            ans.push_back(nums[i]), ans.push_back(nums[i + n]); //push the i th element form x followed by the it th element from y
        
        return ans;// return the required answer
