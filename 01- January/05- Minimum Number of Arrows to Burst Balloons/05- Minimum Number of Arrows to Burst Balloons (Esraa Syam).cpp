    we want to find the minimum number of arrows to shoot all the balloons
    we will sort the balloons in descending order
    we will start from the first balloon and shoot it
    then we will check if the next balloon is inside the first balloon or not
    if it is inside the first balloon we will shoot it
    if it is not inside the first balloon we will shoot it and start from the next balloon
